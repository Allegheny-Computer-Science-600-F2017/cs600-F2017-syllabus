\subsection*{Overview of the Grading Policies}

Final grades are determined after the entire faculty of the Department of
Computer Science --- not just your course instructor for CMPSC 600 --- review
and discuss all of the submitted deliverables.

Your grade in CMPSC 600 will be based on a combination of the following
activities and deliverables. Percentages are not given because we recognize that
the senior thesis experience differs from one student to the next and that there
are many variables, such as the nature of the project and the availability of
external resources, that can influence the relative importance of these
criteria. However, it is important to note that a large percentage of your grade
depends upon your written thesis proposal, the oral defense of your thesis
proposal, and your two thesis chapters.

\begin{itemize}
  \itemsep -.25em

  \item {\bf Class Participation}: This includes meeting regularly with your
    first reader. Although the exact details about frequency and length of each
    meeting must be established with your first reader, you should adhere to the
    previously stated schedule. Additionally, this also requires regular
    contributions, in the form of questions and comments, to the course's Slack
    team. As previously mentioned in the ``Course Schedule'' section, all
    students are required to attend all of the Tuesday class sessions and to
    fully participate in their research group meetings.

  \item {\bf Course Repositories}: This involves students creating, at minimum,
    a GitHub version control repository for each of the assigned course
    projects. Students should click the relevant link in the Slack team to
    accept and begin working on the assignment. Now, you may follow the
    instructions in your repository's README file to complete and submit the
    assignment, regularly using the Travis system and GitHub's tagging mechanism
    to release PDFs of your proposal with versions that adhere to the semantic
    versioning standard. Course instructors will only grade and provide feedback
    on projects that are stored and released through GitHub.

  \item {\bf Status Update}: This document should describe the progress that a
    student has made on completing the research for their senior thesis and
    completing the preliminary research needed to demonstrate its feasibility.
    Written with feedback from your first and second readers, your status update
    should be stored and released through the appropriate GitHub repository.

  \item {\bf Written Thesis.} In consultation with your first reader and in accordance with the stated deadlines, you
    must work out a schedule for completion of your thesis research and your written document. All senior theses are
    due, properly formatted and signed (but not bound), on the stated due date.  Working closely with your first reader,
    you must produce a thesis that both follows the department's style and adheres to professional standards of writing.
    Your grade in CMPSC 610 will be reduced if you fail to submit your unbound thesis on time.

    Following your defense, you must submit the bound copy of your senior thesis by the aforementioned due date.  This
    document must incorporate any changes that were requested by your first and second reader. Seniors who have not
    delivered the signed and bound copies of their senior thesis by the stated deadline will receive an
    incomplete and will not graduate.

  \item{\bf Thesis Defense.} The standards for this presentation are the same as for the proposal defense --- you must
    give a ten to fifteen minute presentation supported by polished slides and adhere to all of the other stated
    requirements for this deliverable. Part of your grade for this defense will depend on how well you are able to
    discuss aspects of your thesis, including implications of your work, connections between your research and other
    areas of computer science, and possible extensions or improvements of your research ideas. You are expected to work
    with your first reader in preparing your oral defense. Your grade in CMPSC 610 will be reduced if you do not
    schedule or conduct your thesis defense by the stated deadlines.

    Unless there are severe extenuating circumstances, students are not allowed to reschedule their defense once they
    have a confirmed date from Pauline Lanzine. To schedule your thesis defense, please check the Google Calendar of
    your first and second readers and come to Pauline's office with three dates and times that fit into your schedule
    and the schedules of your readers. Do not suggest dates and times that conflict with the schedules of your readers!

\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Details About Course Expectations and Deliverables}

\subsubsection*{Class Participation}

Once your readers have been assigned, you must regularly meet with your first
reader, who will report on your participation when the department's faculty meet
to assign final grades for this course. Students are expected to come to each
meeting with a status update on their progress and a meeting agenda. Students
should conclude each meeting by listing the tasks that they want to complete
before the next meeting. In addition, students should regularly participate in
the discussions on the relevant channels in the Slack team for our course. Your
participation on Slack may involve giving a quick status update to your first
reader, inviting your first reader to examine a draft of your proposal or
compile and run a new version of a program, or, within the bounds of the Honor
Code, answering a question from another senior conducting their thesis research.
Finally, all students are required to attend and actively participate in all of
the class sessions that will involve both meetings with their research group and
informal discussion during the departmental coffee and tea session. Evidence of
regular participation must be submitted to the course instructor; failure to
participate and submit this evidence will result in the reduction of your grade
in CMPSC 600.

\subsubsection*{GitHub Repositories}

Every student must accept each of the course projects, thus creating a GitHub
repository customized for the student and that specific project. All of these
GitHub repositories should have a README file that clearly explains the steps
that a student took to complete and release the final version of the assignment.
In addition to containing the \LaTeX{} source code that fulfills the assignment,
each GitHub repository should feature releases of the compiled PDF files that
are tagged with numbers that adhere to the semantic versioning standard
described at \url{http://semver.org/}. The release of a compiled PDF file can be
accomplished automatically by using both the tagging and releases feature
provided by GitHub and, additionally, the continuous integration system provided
by Travis. Your first and second readers will download, read, and comment on a
released PDF at semantic version 1.0.0 or higher. Students who are not able to
automatically release PDFs of their projects may instead manually create them by
using the GitHub interface. Please see an instructor if you have questions about
using GitHub. Failure to either regularly commit to your GitHub repositories or
to make releases of your PDFs will lead to a decrease in your final grade for
CMPSC 600.

\subsubsection*{Thesis Proposal}

The proposal should follow the Department's proposal style and thus must include
an abstract, the main body of your proposal, a tentative schedule for completing
the project, a bibliography, and any other information deemed important by your
first reader. These other details will often include one or more of the
following: a survey of the existing literature; an overview of your proposed
technique; technical diagrams and formal statements of algorithms illustrating
your main approach; the description of an evaluation method; examples or code
artifacts or other evidence that you understand the nature of the work you are
proposing and can feasibly complete it in the time available.  Finally, the
proposal must fully adhere to professional standards of writing.

Although your first reader will be your primary contact person as you write and
revise your thesis proposal, you may involve your second reader as appropriate.
That is, your first reader will make suggestions on your submitted documents
under the expectation that you will revise multiple proposal drafts. You must
work at a pace that will ensure that you complete an approved senior thesis
proposal before the stated deadline. Failure to complete a final thesis proposal
and secure formal approval of your proposal before this date will result in the
reduction of your final grade in CMPSC 600. Securing formal approval of your
thesis involves a student having their first reader note in the GitHub commit
log that the final version of the thesis proposal is suitable for a senior
thesis defense. This evidence must be shown to both a course instructor and
Pauline Lanzine when scheduling your proposal defense; no defense will be
scheduled without this evidence of approval.

\subsubsection*{Proposal Defense}

Lasting approximately one hour in total, a proposal defense starts with a
prepared, formal presentation of about ten minutes in which you lay out the
essential parts of your chosen project under the assumption that your first and
second reader have already studied your thesis proposal. Following the
presentation that is supported by polished slides, you will participate in a
discussion with your readers to identify potential challenges, refine or extend
some aspects of the thesis proposal, and ensure that your project is feasible
and appropriate. All components of your proposal defense should be completed in
consultation with your first and second readers. You must schedule your proposal
defense during the stated course session. Your grade in CMPSC 600 will be
reduced if you miss the deadline for scheduling or conducting the defense of
your thesis proposal. The date of a scheduled defense can only be changed in the
event of a documented extenuating circumstance.

\subsubsection*{Thesis Chapters}

Your two chapters, due on the previously stated date, should represent a
significant addition to or extension of the material in your proposal. Don't
simply ``split the proposal into two chapters'' --- this usually does not work
well since your chapters must represent work completed, not work being proposed.
Chapters are judged according to the same professional standards as the
proposal; they must include a full bibliography, a preliminary table of
contents, lists of any figures and tables, and any other items (e.g., the formal
statement of key algorithms) required by your first reader.

As you write your chapters in consultation with your readers, allow these
individuals to comment on your drafts and then make all of their requested
changes. You will also be given the opportunity to plan and revise your thesis
chapters during certain meetings of your research group. You should plan to
write several drafts of the chapters before submitting them on the due date;
failure to turn them in by the stated deadline will result in the reduction of
your final grade in CMPSC 600.

\subsubsection*{Using Email}

Although we will primarily use Slack for class communication, we will sometimes
use email to send announcements about important class matters. It is your
responsibility to check your email at least once a day and to ensure that you
can reliably send and receive emails. This class policy is based on the
statement about the use of email that appears in {\em The Compass}, the student
handbook.

\subsection*{Honor Code}

The Academic Honor Program that governs the academic program at Allegheny
College is described in the Allegheny Academic Bulletin. The Honor Program
applies to all work that is submitted for academic credit or to meet non-credit
requirements for graduation at Allegheny College. This includes all work
assigned for these classes (e.g., source code, technical diagrams, and your
written content); deliverables that are nearly identical the work of others will
be taken as evidence of violating the Honor Code. All students who have enrolled
in the College will work under the Honor Program. Each student who has
matriculated at the College has acknowledged the following pledge:

\begin{quote}
I hereby recognize and pledge to fulfill my responsibilities, as defined in the Honor Code, and to maintain the
integrity of both myself and the College community as a whole.
\end{quote}

\subsection*{Disability Services}

The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a federal anti-discrimination
statute that provides comprehensive civil rights protection for persons with
disabilities.  Among other things, this legislation requires all students with
disabilities be guaranteed a learning environment that provides for reasonable
accommodation of their disabilities. Students with disabilities who believe they
may need accommodations in this class are encouraged to contact Disability
Services at 332--2898.  Disability Services is part of the Learning Commons and
is located in Pelletier Library. Please do this as soon as possible to ensure
that approved accommodations are implemented in a timely fashion.

\subsection*{Welcome to an Adventure in Computer Science}

CMPSC 600 affords you the opportunity to pursue independent research in computer
science and to ensure that your work has a positive influence on your future
plans, the students and faculty at Allegheny College, and a broader society that
relies heavily on computer hardware and software.  At the start of your senior
year, we invite you to pursue this class with great enthusiasm and vigor.
